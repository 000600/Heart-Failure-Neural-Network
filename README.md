# Heart Failure 

## The Neural Network

The network is densely connected and made in Tensorflow that predicts the probability of one's heart failing based on 11 factors. These factors include:
- Age
- Anaemia
- Creatinine Phosphokinase
- Diabetes
- Blood Pressure
- Platelets

Feel free to tune the hyperparameters or build upon the model!
